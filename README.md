# airbnb-clone-project

  # About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

   # ‚ö°Features Overview

- GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
- Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
- Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
- Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
- Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
- Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
- Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
- Endpoints: /payments/
- Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
- Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
- Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
- Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

  # ‚öôÔ∏èTechnology Stack
  
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
  # Team Roles
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
# üìà API Documentation Overview
- REST API: Detailed documentation available through the OpenAPI standard, including endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- GraphQL API: Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data.

# üìå Database Design Overview
Entities & Key Fields:
- Users
id, username, email, password, is_host
A user can have many bookings and many listed properties.
- Properties
id, title, description, price, owner (FK to User)
A user (host) can list multiple properties.
- Bookings
id, user (FK), property (FK), start_date, end_date
Each booking is linked to one user and one property.
- Payments
id, booking (FK), amount, status, timestamp
Each payment is associated with a booking.
- Reviews
id, user (FK), property (FK), rating, comment
A user can leave one review per property per booking.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Breakdown
- User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and profile updates. Enables secure access control and user tracking.
- Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Powers the core business logic of the platform.
- Booking System
Lets users reserve properties, manage check-in/check-out. Essential for reservation flow and availability control.
- Payment Processing
Integrates payment gateway to handle transactions. Ensures bookings are paid and transaction data is stored securely.
- Review System
Enables users to rate and review properties. Builds trust and community feedback.

# API Documentation
- REST & GraphQL support using OpenAPI. Ensures clear and standard-based integration.
- Database Optimization
- Indexing and caching to improve response time and reduce load on the database.

# üîê API Security Overview
- Authentication: JWT-based login to secure endpoints.
- Authorization: Role-based access to restrict actions (e.g., only hosts can list properties).
- Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse and protect resources with throttling.
- Why Important: Protects user data, ensures payment integrity, and defends against common attacks like brute force or injection.

# üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Overview
- What It Is: Automates code testing, building, and deployment to improve development speed and reliability.
- Why It Matters: Ensures every change is tested and deployed seamlessly with minimal manual effort.

Tools Used:
- GitHub Actions: Automate testing and deployment workflows.
- Docker: Ensures consistent environment across dev, staging, and prod.
- Heroku/Railway: For automatic deployment after successful pipeline runs.
