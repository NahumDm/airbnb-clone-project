# airbnb-clone-project

  # About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# üìà API Documentation Overview
- REST API: Detailed documentation available through the OpenAPI standard, including endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- GraphQL API: Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data.

# üìå Database Design Overview
- Users
  - Fields: id, username, email, password_hash, is_host, date_joined
  - Relationships: One-to-many with properties (as hosts), and bookings (as guests).
  - Users can leave multiple reviews and make multiple bookings.
- Properties
  - Fields: id, title, description, price, location, owner_id (FK to User)
  - Relationships: One-to-many with bookings and reviews.
  - Each property belongs to one host and can be booked many times.
- Bookings
  - Fields: id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), start_date, end_date, status
  - Relationships: One-to-one with a payment; one-to-many with users.
  - A booking is always tied to a specific property and user.
- Payments
  - Fields: id, booking_id (FK), amount, payment_method, timestamp, status
  - Relationships: One-to-one with a booking.
  - Each booking has one associated payment for auditing and tracking.
- Reviews
  - Fields: id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), rating, comment, created_at
  - Relationships: Many-to-one with both users and properties.
  - Reviews are left by users for properties they‚Äôve booked and stayed in.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Breakdown
- User Management
  - Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profile securely.
  - Supports roles like guest or host and handles password hashing and token-based authentication.
  - Crucial for establishing a secure and personalized user environment.
- Property Management
  - Allows hosts to list properties with details like pricing, description, location, and availability.
  - Users can browse and filter listings based on criteria such as price and rating.
  - Forms the core of the platform by enabling property discovery and engagement.
- Booking System
  - Users can reserve available properties by selecting dates and confirming the booking.
  - The system checks for availability, prevents overlapping bookings, and stores reservation details.
  - Vital for managing the rental lifecycle and generating revenue.
- Payment Processing
  - Handles transaction initiation, confirmation, and logging through integrated payment services.
  - Verifies successful transactions and links them to bookings.
  - Ensures that all monetary exchanges are secure and recorded.
- Review System
  - Allows users to leave feedback and ratings after completing a stay.
  - Each review is linked to a booking and visible on the property page.
  - Builds platform trust, credibility, and improves listing transparency.
- API Documentation
  - Uses OpenAPI for REST and supports GraphQL queries.
  - Helps frontend developers and integrators understand API usage and test endpoints.
  - Ensures developer-friendly communication with the backend.
- Database Optimization
  - Adds indexes to frequently queried fields and applies caching where necessary.
  - Reduces query times and enhances scalability under high load.
  - Supports efficient performance and better user experience.

# üîê API Security
- Authentication
  - Uses JWT to secure user sessions and restrict access to authenticated users only.
  - Why: Ensures user identity is verified before accessing protected endpoints, preventing unauthorized access.
- Authorization
  - Role-based permissions (e.g., only hosts can create properties, only booking owners can cancel).
  - Why: Prevents users from performing actions beyond their roles or ownership, protecting data integrity.
- Rate Limiting
  - Limits the number of requests per user/IP over time.
  - Why: Prevents abuse (e.g., brute force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks) and protects server resources.
- Data Validation & Error Handling
  - Validates incoming request data and returns structured error messages.
  - Why: Prevents malformed inputs and potential injection attacks.
- Secure Payment Handling
  - Ensures that payment information is encrypted and only accessible through secure endpoints.
  - Why: Prevents fraud and protects sensitive financial transactions.

# üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline
- What It Is: Automates code testing, building, and deployment to improve development speed and reliability.
- Why It Matters: Ensures every change is tested and deployed seamlessly with minimal manual effort.

Tools Used:
- GitHub Actions: Automate testing and deployment workflows.
- Docker: Ensures consistent environment across dev, staging, and prod.
- Heroku/Railway: For automatic deployment after successful pipeline runs.
